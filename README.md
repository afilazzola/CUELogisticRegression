# An introduction to logistic regression

A univariate analysis is a statistical test that compares a response variable to a series of predictors. There are many different versions including linear regression, ANOVAs, ANCOVAs, and GLMs. This workshops does a deep dive into one of the more frequently used types of univariate analysis - Logistic regression. The code below demonstrates the basics of executing a logistic regression in R. 

[Here](LogisticRegression.pdf) is an explanation of the math and statistical mechanics behind the logistic regression. 

## Getting Started

To get started, install R and the libraries `caret` and `pROC`. All other operations will be conducted in base R. Previous knowledge of R is not necessary, but a prior understanding of linear regression (ordinary least squares) would be beneficial.
